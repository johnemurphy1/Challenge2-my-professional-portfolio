            <p class="right-side bio">My name is Justin Herrera. Currently I work as a payroll & HR manager. I manage those departments for four small companies with plans for 1-3 more companies being opened this year. By the end of this course I will have been in my position for 6 years. This portfolio displays the works that I have created since starting this Bootcamp. My motivation behind taking this course is to gain new knowledge so that I may make a carreer change in the future.  </p>
            <p class="right-side bio">My hopes for my career change is to eventually work in the music or gaming industries. My hobbies include snowboarding, playing video games, going to music festivals and playing with any of my 8 pets. Please enjoy the applications I have worked on below:</p>
